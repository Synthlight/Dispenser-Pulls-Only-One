# Volcanoids Dispenser Pulls Only One
By default, the dispenser pulls anywhere from 1 of an item, to a full stack of it to dispense. (This is a one time thing when it 'reloads'. If it has a partial stack, it will NOT pull more when more appear in storage until the items it has are dispensed.)

This changes the behavior so it'll only even pull one of an item.
